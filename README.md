## Object Tracking with DeepSORT using OpenCV, YOLO, and PyTorch
This repository implements a real-time object tracking system using DeepSORT with computer vision (CV) libraries, YOLO for object detection, and PyTorch for deep learning computations.

### Project Goals:
* Integrate YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for identifying objects in a video stream.
* Utilize DeepSORT (Simple Online and Real-time Tracking with a Deep Appearance Descriptor) algorithm to track detected objects across video frames.
* Visualize object detections and tracks on the video, displaying object IDs and bounding boxes.

### Technologies Used:
* Python (main programming language)
* PyTorch (deep learning framework)
* OpenCV (computer vision library)
* YOLO pre-trained model (weights file) - (Specify the chosen YOLO version, e.g., YOLOv5)

### Dependencies:

The project relies on various libraries. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a comprehensive list of required libraries and their versions.

### Getting Started:
**Download a YOLO pre-trained model:**
* Download a pre-trained YOLO model (weights file) compatible with your chosen YOLO version (e.g., YOLOv5). Several options are available online.
* Place the downloaded weights file in the project directory (e.g., a folder named 'weights').

**Optional:**
* The script might accept arguments for specifying the video source (e.g., webcam or video file path).
* You can explore modifying the code to adjust DeepSORT parameters or customize visualizations.

### Disclaimer:
Pre-trained YOLO models may have limitations in object detection accuracy or class types. Choose a model trained on relevant object categories for your tracking task.

### Contribution
We welcome contributions to this project! You can help by:

* Implementing support for different YOLO versions or object detection models.
* Exploring alternative tracking algorithms.
* Enhancing visualization options.
